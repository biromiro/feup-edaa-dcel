# Doubly Connected Edge List on the Map Overlay Problem
Implementation of the Doubly Connected Edge List (DCEL) Data Structure and application on the Map Overlay Problem for the *Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures* (EDAA) course @FEUP.


## Dataset

Given the map overlay problem, different maps can be used to extract different - and interesting - queries about a given region. The used maps were obtained from:
